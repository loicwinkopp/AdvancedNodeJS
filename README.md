# AdvancedNodeJS

Web App to manage blog posts. Created with React, Redux, Node.js, Redis.

Please take a look at the most interesting files I've been working on:

* ``` /services/cache.js ``` in which I use data cahing with Redis
* ``` /.travis.yml ``` which is the configuration for the continuous integration provider Travis CI
* the ``` /tests ``` folder in which I use Jest for testing the application

Made from the Stephen Grider's starter pack and with the help of the Udemy Course "NodeJS: Advanced Concepts"
